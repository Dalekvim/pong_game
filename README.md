# pong_game
## Description
This is a [Pong Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) that I made mostly using Javascript and a [HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp). It's pritty simple and doesn't have a scoring system but I still find it's fun to play with.
## How to Use
Use **W and S keys** for the Player on the **Left** and the **Up and Down arrows** for the One on the **Right**.
